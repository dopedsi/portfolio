        <h3>I was tasked with designing a dashboard for an apartment leasing product. The aim of the product was to make finding and applying to apartments an easy process. Note that this product specifically targets users looking to rent apartments, not buy/sell.

        <h1>The challenge</h1>
        <h3>To design a dashboard for an apartment leasing SaaS that incorporates three important features:<br><br>
            <li>Apartment search with filters
            </li>
            <li>Starred apartments
            </li>
            <li>Apartment that have been applied to
            </li>
        <br>
            For each feature certain elements were required to be included at the behest the client.<br>
            For the search feature the client requested specific location searches, min/max square metres, and a lower/upper limit for monthly rent.

            For starred apartments the location, costs per month and a picture.

            For apartment that have been applied to the location, monthly rent, a picture and the status of the application.

    <div class="discovery">
        <h1>Discovery</h1>
        <h3>I started to research competitors in the property market to find elements of their designs that excelled or didn't excell in UX.
            <br><br>
            The three main pain points were:
    
            <br><br>
            <li>Maps lacked intuitiveness</li>
            <li>Filters had limitations such as not allowing for ranges</li>
            <li>There was no feedback on apartments users had seen/applied for</li>
    
            <br>
            To solve these issues I decided to look into how search engines and map applications cater to users needs. I also looked at the filter patterns of popular e-commerce sites as their user page is global and considerably larger than most real estate websites.
            
        </h3>

    <div class="define"></div>
    <h1>Define & Design</h1>
    <h3>Using all the research I collated, I formed user personas, user flows, and user journey maps.<br><br>
        
        <img src="images/leasepro-flow.png" alt="Leasepro flow" width="100%">
    <br><br>
    When tackling the search bar I had noted that some companies opted for purely a city/town search, whereas others opted for a more diverse selection.
    <br>Two Australian companies used a filter option called 'include neighboring areas', however I felt this was a wrong decision to make. There are a good amount of users who would be unaware of which areas are adjacent to eachother.<br>
    The other problem that arises is that a user may get 110 results for their search but only 10 of them are located in their desired location.<br>
    I resolved to search by city, area or postcode as this narrowed searches down more. I also made sure parts of the search could be cancelled.
<br><br>
    As part of the results I separated normal search results, starred and applied properties. Starred and applied properties would not be reliant on filters from a current search. The map would also show the locations of these properties. <br><br>

    <img src="images/leasepro-components.png" alt="Search, filters and results">

    <br><br>

    I wanted to add a feature I found in a map application where results can update as the user moves their map.<br> I felt it necessary that both the results and the properties map should correlate to one another. However, as the constant update can be quite jarring for some users. This option was made as a checkbox that the user could choose to use.<br><br>
    Another part of the map that needed some thought was showing the amount of results. I felt that putting this feedback inside the map made sense for two reasons. <br><br>
    <li>If a users zooms in/out or move the map it will indicate the selection of properties from the results</li>
    <li>It helped to preserve white space on the white of the page</li> <br>
    <img src="images/leasepro-map.png" alt="Map draft vs final" width="100%">
    <br><br>

    A problem I noticed in competitor searches was that once you applied the filters to a search, they then disappeared from view so it was hard to keep track of the specifics you were searching for.<br>
    I created a filter bar to run along the top with an all filters button to bring up an overlay. This was important to include for users who want to apply all filters before the results update and for mobile responsiveness. <br><br>

    Solving the final pain point from my research was a simple state change/copy change on a button. 
    <br>To view applications and their status, I designed a separate page to manage these applications. I added a withdraw application button to each card so the user was free to pick and choose properties if they were approved for multiple/changed their mind.
