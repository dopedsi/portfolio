    <h1>Background</h1>
    <h3>It was announced in 2021 that National Rail would be rebranded as Great British Railways and become a state-run company. Growing up in the UK, I had experienced pain points with the company for most of my life and when taking a look at their app and website, that was still very much the case.
        <br>
        What better time to do a complete overhaul.

    <h1>The challenge</h1>
    <h3>To completely redesign both the app and website without any contraints.

<div class="discovery">
    <h1>Discovery</h1>
    <h3>I conducted user surveys, interviews and usability tests to discover what users pain points were. The most common frustrations were:
        <br><br>
        <li>the UI design being outdated</li>
        <li>having to leave the app/website in order to buy a ticket</li>
        <li>nothing working as they should</li>
        <br><br>
        In the usability tests, abandonment rate was extremely high as users gave up on tasks through sheer frustration.<br><br>
        
        I had found through secondary research, that the company was moving from paper tickets to plastic cards, called smart cards, as well as e-tickets and m-tickets. I wanted to make sure I incorporated this feature in my design.<br><br>

        To ensure that customers retained some familiarity with the booking form, I conducted a competitor analysis and found that the most common version was a left-aligned vertical input form, although horizontal, center-aligned forms were also common.<br><br>

<h3>Using all the research I collated, I then formed user personas, user empathy maps, and user journey maps. These served as a reference for my design phase later on.

    <h3>With more time available, I would've attempted to build out the information architecture more and created a full prototype of the website. With mobile usage being more common, I focused my efforts on the native app than the website.
