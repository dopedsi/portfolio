        <h1>Background</h1>
        <h3>E2 is a global EdTech company based out of Melbourne, Australia. E2's product is a Learning     Management System (LMS) and the company itself operates in the B2B/B2C space.  
            <br>
            As lead designer, I developed designs that would benefit the experience of all 1.5 million users focusing on accessibility, culture/local customs and pedagogical principles (having been a former teacher myself).<br>
            For our clients that used our system for their own students, I ensured that the information architecture was structured to give ease of use to users implementing their own content.

    <div class="challenge">
        <h1>The challenge</h1>
        <h3>Our analytics were showing a dropdoff in user retention at the beginning of courses. The courses contained interactive videos with timestamps that would link to a set of questions further down on the page relating to content in the video.<br>
        Pages that contained interactive videos were either being skipped entirely, or the linked questions were being incorrectly answered.<br>
        The aim of the project was to discover why this was happening and to resolve the issue. Our clients heavily used these videos in their courses so we needed to improve the UX before they launched their new courses in the next semester.
        </h3>
    </div>
    
    
    <div class="discovery">
        <h1>Discovery</h1>
        <h3>I conducted interviews and usability tests with users in multiple countries (primarily India and Brazil - our largest markets) to discover what the overlying problem was.
            <br>
             As our product catered to both students and client, this research was conducted in two parts.
            <br>
            Whilst a small minority of students simply wished to skip to a particular area of content they were looking for (these users had previously completed the course and were looking to refresh their knowledge before a test), the majority of students were getting confused about how the video functionality worked.<br>
            The three main pain points were:
    
            <br><br>
            <li>users were unsure which question pertained to which timestamp</li>
            <li>there was an accessibility issues with correct and incorrect answers</li>
            <li>videos were too long, especially for beginners</li>
    
            <br>
            For the final pain point, as it was not an issue I could personally solve, I spoke to the content & media production teams (internally and externally) and advised that content in the videos needed to be trimmed down/less complex. 
            
            <br><br>I then conducted interviews with both clients and internal colleagues on the content team who would create our own courses.
            <br><br><img src="images/e2-internal.png" alt="Internal usability test" width="100%"><br><br>
            I discovered the following issues with content creation:
            <br><br>
            <li>widgets had to exist before a timestamp link to the video could be generated</li>
            <li>setting the timestamps up seemed difficult</li>
            <li>the user interface was confusing</li>
            
            <br><br>
            <img src="images/e2-select-widget.png" alt="Video select widget" width="100%"><br><br>
            
            <br>In order to design the best solution for both parties, the whole interactive video widget itself needed not just a UI refresh, but an entire redo to benefit both users' experience.

    <h1>Define</h1>
    <h3>Using all the research I collated, I formed user personas, user flows, and user journey maps. These incorporated both the student side in completing the activities as well as the client side of creating the activities.<br><br>
        
    I started with how the widget was structured in the backend.<br>
    For the client I had to focus on ease of implementation. Users needed a simple, intuitive design to replace the existing convoluted one. 
    <br>
    The focus would be on how the user could select scorable widgets and timestamps. Decisions made here translated directly over to the student UI.<br><br>
    <img src="images/e2-school-flow.png" alt="E2 school flow" width="100%">
    <br><br>

    For the student, I realised that the video stopping and auto scrolling down to the scorable widgets on the page was quite jarring for the user. This cognitive dissonance not only caused confusion about which question out of several they were currently answering, but also lead some users to believe that had skipped ahead to a new page.<br>
    To reflect how the content creation interface worked, I decided it would be best to move the questions inside the video widget itself.<br><br>

        <h1>Results</h1>
        <h3>Upon getting user feedback from usability tests, we went ahead with development.
            After two weeks we analysed the data and found that:
            <br><br>
            <li>activity completion rose by 82%</li>
            <li>correct answers grew by 37%</li>
            <li>overall course completion increased by 24%</li>
            <li>in turn new course sign ups increased for higher levels by 20%</li>
            <br>
            Feedback for improvements were to replace question labels with radio buttons as we were developing a new translation feature that would cater to 'zero-English' students. Courses needed to minimise any rubrics/unnecessary words as these would need to be translated into several languages.
            <br><br>
            <img src="images/e2-v3.png" alt="E2 widget version 3" width="80%"><br<br>
            We also decided to include timestamp indicators so students would be ready for the questions to come up.
            This inclusion also helped students to focus more intently on the video content nearer to the question which meant that correct answers and activity completion rates rose further.

            <h1>Key takeaways from working at E2 during a pandemic</h1>
            <h3>There were of courses many challenges in working fully remote from home during the pandemic, but also a lot of lessons to be learned.<br>
                Zoom meetings amongst colleagues became the standard and collaboration and proficiency using online tools greatly improved.
                <br> 
                When we were able to come into the office (during sporadic restriction eases), we used this time to brainstorm and ideate, althought not everyone could participate due to limited numbers being allowed in the workplace.<br><br>
                Whilst we couldn't meet in person and take part in extracurricular activities, the company organised events such as online trivia events with prizes where we could catch up with all employees from all over the world.
